The HIPAA Security Rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. Additionally, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has also issued guidance on the cybersecurity of medical devices.
In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the protection of personal data, including PHI, and applies to organizations that handle personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. The GDPR requires organizations to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access and data breaches.


## Types of cyber threats

### There are several specific types of cyber threats that target digital health systems. Some examples include:

    1. Ransomware: This type of threat involves malware that encrypts data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can cause significant disruption to healthcare delivery, as well as compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
    
    2. Phishing: This type of threat involves the use of email or other forms of communication to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. Phishing can lead to the compromise of login credentials, as well as the spread of malware.
    
    3. Insider threats: This type of threat involves individuals with authorized access to digital health systems who use that access to steal or corrupt data. Insider threats can lead to the loss of PHI, as well as the disruption of healthcare delivery.
    
    4. Medical Device Hacking: These types of threat target the Medical Devices that are connected to the Internet, and can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, it can lead to serious consequences such as the manipulation of device settings, unauthorized access to device data, and disruption of the device's intended operation.
    
    5. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): This type of threat involves the use of sophisticated methods to gain and maintain unauthorized access to digital health systems over an extended period. APTs can lead to the exfiltration of large amounts of PHI, as well as the disruption of healthcare delivery.
    
The potential consequences of these threats can be severe, including the loss of PHI, identity theft, harm to an individual's reputation, and the disruption of healthcare delivery. Data breaches can also result in significant financial losses, as well as damage to an organization's reputation. Additionally, in the case of medical device hacking, it can put patient's safety at risk. Cybersecurity threats to digital health systems are a growing concern, and organizations need to be vigilant in their efforts to protect against them.

### There have been several high-profile incidents of cyber threats to digital health systems in recent years. Some examples include:

    1. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017: This attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, including several hospitals in the UK. The attack caused widespread disruption to healthcare delivery, as well as the compromise of PHI.
    
    2. The Anthem data breach in February 2015: This breach exposed the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 78.8 million individuals. Anthem, one of the largest health insurance companies in the US, was targeted by cyber attackers who gained unauthorized access to its IT systems.
    
    3. The UCLA Health System data breach in July 2015: This breach exposed the personal information of 4.5 million individuals, including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. The attack was a result of a phishing email sent to an employee of UCLA Health System, which resulted in the compromise of login credentials.
    
    4. The Medtronic Insulin Pumps hack: In 2017, the FDA issued a warning about the potential hacking of the Medtronic insulin pumps, which can be used to change the dosage of insulin delivered to patients.
    
    5. The Blackbaud data breach in 2020: A cyber-attack on the software company Blackbaud exposed the personal information of millions of individuals, including patients and donors of healthcare organizations. The attack resulted in the compromise of PHI, including Social Security numbers, addresses, and financial information.
    
These examples demonstrate the various ways in which digital health systems can be targeted by cyber threats, and the potential consequences of these threats.
